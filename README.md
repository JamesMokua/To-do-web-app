## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment:
- I built this app using my own UI design concepts.
- I worked with tasks on my personal to do list that i created.
## How to navigate on this project
This web app has: 
- All
- Completed
- Not Completed
They represent all the tasks in the to do list and the tasks can either e marked as completed or not completed.
## Why I built the project this way
I didn't use state management library such as Redux on purpose. For this app simple ```useState``` is sufficient as this is a small Application
## If I had more time i would change this
- Create more precise commits
- Create branches and use pull requests to generate a good workflow
- Use Trello to handle my tasks during development
- Replace State Management with a database and use APIs to make CRUD operations.
## Available Scripts
```
$npm start
```
